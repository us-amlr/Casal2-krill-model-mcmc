In a converged mcmc all estimated parameters should have rhat values < 1.1. 

'rhat_500K_110,000.pdf' shows the diagnostic from an earlier version of the krill model after 110,000 iterations, keeping every 1,000th, for 20-year projections with 500,000 tonnes removed annually. The MCMC required about 25 minutes running the three chains simultaneously. Three parameters had Rhat values â‰¥ 1.1, indicating they needed more mcmc samples to converge.  The parameter names for each line in the rhat plot were identified using 'rhats[order(rhats,decreasing=TRUE)]'. These were selectivity parameters '[FbiomSel].at50' (rhat = 1.46), '[AMLR_Sel].ato95' (1.38) and '[FbiomSel].ato95' (1.1).

'rhat_500K_11,000,000.pdf' shows the rhat diagnostic from the earlier model after 11,000,000 iterations, keeping every 10,000th sample. These mcmcs required 47 hours to complete, running the three chains simultaneously. One selectivity parameter '[FbiomSel].a50' = 1.12 with all others < 1.05.


'rhat_600K_3,300,000_iters.pdf' shows the diagnostic from the August 22, 2023 version of the model for 3,300,000 iterations.

In most cases the parameters with rhat values > 1.1 are selectivity parameters.
