The rhat diagnostic indicates model convergence when the rhat values for all estimated parameters are less than 1.1. 

'rhat_600K_110,000_iters.pdf' shows the diagnostic for the non-simplex recruitment multiplier model after 110,000 MCMC samples, keeping every 1,000th, for 20-year projections with 600,000 tonnes removed annually. The MCMC required about 25 minutes running the three chains simultaneously. The parameter names for each line in the rhat plot were identified using 'rhats[order(rhats,decreasing=TRUE)]' (see file 'rhat_values_110,000_iters.txt'). One parameter, a selectivity parameter for fishery length-frequencies (selectivity[Fsh_lf_Sel].ato95) had an Rhat value of 1.62, indicating the model needed more MCMC samples to converge.  

'rhat_600K_3,300,000_iters.pdf' shows the diagnostic for 3,300,000 iterations. The rhat values of each estimated parameter are reported in 'rhat_values_3,300,000_iters.txt'. The fishery length-frequency parameter 'selectivity[Fsh_lf_Sel].ato95' decreased to 1.24 but remained above 1.1.

In most configurations of the model when parameters had rhat values > 1.1 they were selectivity parameters.
