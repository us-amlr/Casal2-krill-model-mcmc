In a converged mcmc all estimated parameters should have rhat values < 1.1. 'rhat_500K_110,000.pdf' shows the diagnostic after 110,000 iterations, keeping every 1,000th, for 20-year projections with 500,000 tonnes removed annually. The MCMC required about 25 minutes running the three chains simultaneously. Three parameters had Rhat values â‰¥ 1.1, indicating they needed more mcmc samples to converge.  The parameter names for each line in the rhat plot were identified using 'rhats[order(rhats,decreasing=TRUE)]'. These were selectivity parameters '[FbiomSel].at50' (rhat = 1.46), '[AMLR_Sel].ato95' (1.38) and '[FbiomSel].ato95' (1.1).

'rhat_500K_11,000,000.pdf' shows the rhat diagnostic after 11,000,000 iterations, keeping every 10,000th sample. These mcmcs required 47 hours to complete, running the three chains simultaneously. One selectivity parameter '[FbiomSel].a50' = 1.12 with all others < 1.05.

The chains with 110,000 mcmc samples produced SSB/SSB0 values at the end of the projection period of 0.751, 0.753, and 0.756. The 11,000,000 mcmc sample chains produced lower SSB/SSB0 values at the end of the projection of 0.715, 0.715, and 0.712.
